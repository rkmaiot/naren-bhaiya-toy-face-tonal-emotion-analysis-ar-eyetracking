**Naren Bhaiya** is a smart toy based on Vivekananda’s childhood Naren which analyzes the emotional well-being in children through facial analysis and tonal analysis and empowering them by providing Integrated Body-Mind training and Life Skills training through individual Apps

* An integrated AI based Camera sensor with LCD display connected to Raspberry PI 4 running localized multi-modal emotion detection using facial analysis and voice tonal analysis algorithms is prototyped
* Randomized conversations based on Anxiety/Loneliness scale questionnaires  are initiated and the child’s responses are recorded to measure the emotion indexes
* Open Source software implemented in Python such as Deep Face & OpenVokaturi is utilized for facial and tonal analysis
* Once the emotion detection values stream from the system, a negative emotion index is computed real-time and averaged over a specified time period
* If emotion index is less than a specified threshold, specific curated content (Ex: Inspirational stories) is played out to the child to lift the child’s spirits


* Facial emotion (angry, fear, neutral, sad, disgust, happy and surprise) analysis done using a lightweight Deepface framework.
* Voice tonal analysis done using the Open Vokaturi software that can understand the emotion in a voice. Vokaturi can measure the state of mind (happy, sad, afraid, angry and neutral) from a voice.
